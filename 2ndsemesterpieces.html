            <p>Throughout my 2nd Semester of Studio Art 1, my favorite piece
              would be my Gelli Printing Collage. I believe this piece captures
              my art skills and creativity, and shows a little bit about me
              through art. I wanted to combine the idea of music and art, two
              of my favorite hobbies, into one piece. This piece represents
              how sometimes it all feels like too much. There have been times
              when I've wanted to quit a hobby that means so much to me. The
              pressure from others and competition makes it hard to stay
              motivated, and leads to disinterest in the subject. Over time, I
              have learned to love art by following my own rules and understanding
              how to enjoy it. This piece gave me a chance to show my love for the
              hobbies that I love, using a technique that I have never used before.
